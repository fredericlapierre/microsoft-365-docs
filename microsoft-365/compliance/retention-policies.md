# Overview of retention policies

>*[Microsoft 365 licensing guidance for security & compliance](https://aka.ms/ComplianceSD).*

For most organizations, the volume and complexity of their data is increasing daily — email, documents, instant messages, and more. Effectively managing or governing this information is important because you need to:
  
- **Comply proactively with industry regulations and internal policies** that require you to retain content for a minimum period of time — for example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act might require you to retain certain types of content for seven years. 
    
- **Reduce your risk in the event of litigation or a security breach** by permanently deleting old content that you're no longer required to keep. 
    
- **Help your organization to share knowledge effectively and be more agile** by ensuring that your users work only with content that's current and relevant to them. 
    
A retention policy can help you achieve all of these goals. Managing content commonly requires two actions:
  
- **Retaining** content so that it can't be permanently deleted before the end of the retention period. 
    
- **Deleting** content permanently at the end of the retention period. 
    
With a retention policy, you can:
  
- Decide proactively whether to retain content, delete content, or both — retain and then delete the content.
    
- Apply a single policy to the entire organization or specific locations or users.
    
- Apply a policy to all content or content meeting certain conditions, such as content containing specific keywords or [specific types of sensitive information](what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for.md).
    
When content is subject to a retention policy, people can continue to edit and work with the content as if nothing's changed because the content is retained in place, in its original location. But if someone edits or deletes content that's subject to the policy, a copy is saved to a secure location where it's retained while the policy is in effect.
  
Finally, some organizations have to comply with regulations such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 17a-4, which requires that after a retention policy is turned on, it cannot be turned off or made less restrictive. To meet this requirement, you can use Preservation Lock. After a policy's been locked, no one (including an administrator) can turn off the policy or make it less restrictive.
  
You create and manage retention policies from the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/): **Policies** > **Data** > **Retention**

Alternatively, you can navigate to the same place in the Microsoft 365 compliance center by using **Solutions** > **Information governance** > **Retention** tab. 

**If you want the ability to review content before it's permanently deleted,** consider using [retention labels](labels.md) instead of a retention policy. When you create a retention label, you can set up a [disposition review](disposition-reviews.md) to review the content at the end of its retention period.

## How a retention policy works with content in place

When you include a location such as a site or mailbox in a retention policy, the content remains in its original location. People can continue to work with their documents or mail as if nothing's changed. But if they edit or delete content that's included in the policy, a copy of the content as it existed when you applied the policy is retained.
  
For SharePoint site collections, a copy of the original content is retained in the Preservation Hold library when users edit or delete it. For email and public folders, the copy is retained in the Recoverable Items folder. These secure locations and the retained content are not visible to most people. With a retention policy, people do not even need to know that their content is subject to the policy.
  
Notes:
  
- Teams (chat) content is stored in Exchange, where the policy is applied based on message type (email or conversation).
    
- A retention policy applied to an Office 365 group includes both the group mailbox and site.

- The Preservation Hold library consumes storage quota for the site.
    
### Content in OneDrive accounts and SharePoint sites

A retention policy is applied at the level of a site collection. When you include a SharePoint site collection or OneDrive account in a retention policy, a Preservation Hold library is used to retain documents. This library is automatically created if it doesn't already exist. You can view this library on the **Site contents** page in the top-level site of the site collection. Most users can't view the Preservation Hold library because it's visible only to site collection administrators.
  
If a person attempts to change or delete content in a site that's subject to retain and delete, or retain-only, first the policy checks whether the content's been changed since the policy was applied. If this is the first change since the policy was applied, the retention policy copies the content to the Preservation Hold library, and then allows the person to change or delete the original content. Any content in the site collection can be copied to the Preservation Hold library, even if the content does not match the query used by the retention policy.

Copying content to the Preservation Hold library applies to content that exists when the retention policy is applied. In addition, any new content that's created or added to the site collection after it was included in the policy will be retained after deletion. However, new content isn't copied to the Preservation Hold library the first time it's edited, only when it's deleted. To retain all versions of a file, turn on versioning, as explained in a following [section](#how-a-retention-policy-works-with-document-versions-in-a-site-collection).
  
Note that a user receives an error if they try to delete a library, list, folder, or site that's subject to a retention policy. A user can delete a folder if they first move or delete any files in the folder that are subject to the policy. Also, the Preservation Hold library is created only when the first item needs to be copied to the library and not when you create the retention policy. Therefore, to test your policy, you first need to edit or delete a document in a site that is subject to the policy, and then browse to the Preservation Hold library to view the retained copy.
  
After a retention policy is assigned to a OneDrive account or SharePoint site, the paths the content takes depend on whether the retention policy is to retain and delete, to retain only, or delete only.

When the retention policy is to retain and delete:

![Diagram of content lifecycle in SharePoint and OneDrive](../media/Retention_Diagram_of_retention_flow_in_sites.png)
  
1. **If the content is modified or deleted** during the retention period: A copy of the original content as it existed when the retention policy was assigned is created in the Preservation Hold library. There, a timer job runs periodically and identifies items whose retention period has expired. Those items are then moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin, where they're permanently deleted at the end of 93 days. The second-stage Recycle Bin is not visible to end users (only the first-stage Recycle Bin is), but site collection admins can view and restore content from there.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To help prevent inadvertent data loss, content is never automatically deleted from the Preservation Hold library but moves to the second-stage Recycle Bin. There, the grace period of 93 days lets admins recover this content, if necessary.
    
2. **If the content is not modified or deleted** during the retention period: At the end of the retention period, the document is moved to the first-stage Recycle Bin. If a user deletes the document from there or empties this Recycle Bin (also known as purging), the document is moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin. A 93-day retention period spans both the first-stage and second-stage recycle bins. At the end of 93 days, the document is permanently deleted from wherever it resides, in either the first-stage or second-stage Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin is not indexed and therefore unavailable for searching. As a result, an eDiscovery search can't find any Recycle Bin content on which to place a hold. 

When the retention policy is retain-only, or delete-only, the contents paths are variations of retain and delete:

#### Content paths for retain-only retention policy

1. **If the content is modified or deleted** during the retention period: A copy of the original document is created in the Preservation Hold library and retained until the end of the retention period, when the copy in the Preservation Hold library is moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin and is permanently deleted after 93 days.

2. **If the content is not modified or deleted** during the retention period: Nothing happens before and after the retention period; the document remains in its original location.

#### Content paths for delete-only retention policy

1. **If the content is deleted** during the retention period: The document is moved to first-stage Recycle Bin. If a user deletes the document from there or empties this Recycle Bin, the document is moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin. A 93-day retention period spans both the first-stage and second-stage recycle bins. At the end of 93 days, the document is permanently deleted from wherever it resides, in either the first-stage or second-stage Recycle Bin. If the content is modified during the retention period, it follows the same deletion path after the content expires.

2. **If the content is not deleted** during the retention period: At the end of the retention period, the document is moved to the first-stage Recycle Bin. If the content is deleted during the retention period, the document is immediately moved to first-stage Recycle Bin. If a user deletes the document from there or empties this Recycle Bin (also known as purging), the document is moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin. A 93-day retention period spans both the first-stage and second-stage recycle bins. At the end of 93 days, the document is permanently deleted from wherever it resides, in either the first-stage or second-stage Recycle Bin. The Recycle Bin is not indexed and therefore unavailable for searching. As a result, an eDiscovery search can't find any Recycle Bin content on which to place a hold.

### Content in mailboxes and public folders

For a user's mail, calendar, and other items, a retention policy is applied at the level of a mailbox. For a public folder, a retention policy is applied at the folder level, not the mailbox level. Both a mailbox and a public folder use the Recoverable Items folder to retain items. Only people whom have been assigned eDiscovery permissions can view items in another user's Recoverable Items folder.
  
By default, when a person deletes a message in a folder other than the Deleted Items folder, the message is moved to the Deleted Items folder. When a person deletes an item in the Deleted Items folder, the message is moved to the Recoverable Items folder. In addition, a person can soft delete an item (SHIFT+DELETE) in any folder, which bypasses the Deleted Items folder and moves the item directly to the Recoverable Items folder.
  
A process periodically evaluates items in the Recoverable Items folder. If an item doesn't match the rules of at least one retention policy, the item is permanently deleted (also called hard deleted) from the Recoverable Items folder.
  
When a person attempts to change certain properties of a mailbox item — such as the subject, body, attachments, senders and recipients, or date sent or received for a message — a copy of the original item is saved to the Recoverable Items folder before the change is committed. This action happens for each subsequent change. At the end of the retention period, copies in the Recoverable Items folder are permanently deleted.
  
When the retention policy is to retain and delete:

![Diagram of retention flow in email and public folders](../media/88f174cc-bbf4-4305-93d7-0515f496c8f9.png)

1. **If the item is modified or permanently deleted** by the user (either SHIFT+DELETE or deleted from Deleted Items) during the retention period, the item is moved (or copied, in the case of edit) to the Recoverable Items folder. There, a process runs periodically and identifies items whose retention period has expired, and these items are permanently deleted within 14 days of the end of the retention period. Note that 14 days is the default setting, but it can be configured up to 30 days.
    
2. **If the item is not modified or deleted** during the retention period, the same process runs periodically on all folders in the mailbox and identifies items whose retention period has expired, and these items are permanently deleted within 14 days of the end of the retention period. Note that 14 days is the default setting, but it can be configured up to 30 days. 
When the retention policy is retain-only, or delete-only, the contents paths are variations of retain and delete:

#### Content paths for retain-only retention policy

1. **If the item is modified or deleted** during the retention period: A copy of the original item is created in the Recoverable Items folder and retained until the end of the retention period, when the copy in the Recoverable Items folder is permanently deleted within 14 days after the item expires. 

2. **If the item is not modified or deleted** during the retention period: Nothing happens before and after the retention period; the item remains in its original location.

#### Content paths for delete-only retention policy

1. **If the item is not deleted** during the retention period: At the end of the retention period, the item is moved to the Recoverable items folder. 

2. **If the item is deleted** during the period, the item is immediately moved to the Recoverable items folder. If a user deletes the item from there or empties the Recoverable items folder, the item is permanently deleted. Otherwise, the item is permanently deleted after being in the Recoverable items folder for 14 days. 

### When a user leaves the organization

**Exchange** 

If a user leaves your organization and the user's mailbox is included in a retention policy, the mailbox becomes an inactive mailbox when the user's Office 365 account is deleted. The contents of an inactive mailbox are still subject to any retention policy that was placed on the mailbox before it was made inactive, and the contents are available to an eDiscovery search. For more information, see [Inactive mailboxes in Exchange Online](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md).

**OneDrive**

If a user leaves your organization, any files subject to a retention policy or containing retention labels will remain for the duration of the policy or label. During that time period, all sharing access continues to work. When the retention period expires, content moves into the Site Collection Recycle Bin and is not accessible to anyone except the admin. If a document is marked by a retention policy as a record, it will not be deleted until the retention period is over, after which time the content is permanently deleted.

**SharePoint**

When a user leaves your organization, any content created by that user is not affected because SharePoint is considered a collaborative environment, unlike a user's mailbox or OneDrive account.

## How a retention policy works with document versions in a site collection

Versioning is a feature of all document libraries in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. By default, versioning retains a minimum of 500 major versions, though you can increase this limit. For more information, see [Enable and configure versioning for a list or library](https://support.office.com/article/1555d642-23ee-446a-990a-bcab618c7a37).
  
A retain policy (retention policy that retains content instead of delete-only) retains all versions of a document in a SharePoint site collection or OneDrive account. When a document subject to a hold or retain policy is edited for the first time, a version of the original document is copied to the Preservation Hold library. When a document subject to a hold or retain policy is deleted, all versions are copied to the Preservation Hold library if versioning is enabled. Each version of a document in the Preservation Hold library exists as a separate item with its own retention period:
  
- If the retention policy is based on when the content was created, each version has the same expiration date as the original document. The original document and its versions all expire at the same time.
    
- If the retention policy is based on when the content was last modified, each version has its own expiration date based on when the original document was modified to create that version. The original documents and its versions expire independently of each other.

> [!NOTE]
> The preserved versions of SharePoint and OneDrive documents are not searchable by eDiscovery tools.

## Retaining content for a specific period of time

With a retention policy, you can retain content indefinitely or for a specific number of days, months, or years. The duration for how long content is retained is calculated from the age of the content, not from when the retention policy is applied. You can choose whether the age is based on when the content was created or (for OneDrive and SharePoint) when it was last modified.
  
For example, if you want to retain content in a site collection for seven years since it was last modified, and a document in that site collection hasn't been modified in six years, the document will be retained for only another year if it's not modified. If the document is edited again, the age of the document is calculated from the new last modified date, and it will be retained for another seven years.
  
Similarly, if you want to retain content in a mailbox for seven years, and a message was sent six years ago, the message will be retained for only one year. For Exchange content, the age is always based on the date received or sent (they are the same). Retaining content based on when it was last modified applies only to site content in OneDrive and SharePoint.
  
You can choose whether you want the content to be permanently deleted at the end of the retention period. A retention policy can also delete old content without retaining it. See the next section.
  
![Retention settings page](../media/b05f84e5-fc71-4717-8f7b-d06a29dc4f29.png)
  
## Deleting content that's older than a specific age

A retention policy can both retain and then delete content, or delete old content without retaining it.
  
If your retention policy deletes content, it's important to understand that the time period specified for a retention policy is calculated from the time when the content was created or modified, not the time since the policy was assigned.
  
![Deletion settings](../media/042f9571-96f4-458f-8f38-fad3ed68ed31.png)
  
For example, suppose that you create a retention policy that deletes content after three years, and then assign that policy to all OneDrive accounts, which contain a lot of content that was created four or five years ago. In this case, a lot of content will be deleted soon after assigning the retention policy for the first time. For this reason, **a retention policy that deletes content can have a considerable impact on your content**. 
  
Therefore, before you assign a retention policy to a site collection for the first time, you should first consider the age of the existing content and how the policy may impact that content. You may also want to communicate the new policy to your users before assigning it, to give them time to assess the possible impact. Note this warning that appears when you review the settings for your retention policy just before creating it.
  
![Warning about deleting content](../media/59c26b19-3628-4cc1-9a73-a05127a8e81b.png)
  
## Advanced settings that apply a policy only to content that meets certain conditions

A retention policy can apply to all content in the locations that it includes, or you can choose to apply a retention policy only to content that contains specific keywords or [specific types of sensitive information](what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for.md).
  
![Advanced retention options](../media/e8d9dd42-c062-4e8b-a2ca-bffe3ea298e0.png)
  
### Retain content that contains specific keywords

You can apply a retention policy only to content that satisfies certain conditions, and then take retention actions on just that content. The conditions available now support applying a retention policy to content that contains specific words or phrases. You can refine your query by using search operators like AND, OR, and NOT. For more information on these operators, see [Keyword queries and search conditions for Content Search](keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md).
  
Support for adding searchable properties (for example, **subject:**) is coming soon.
  
Query-based retention uses the search index to identify content.
  
![Query editor](../media/2c31b412-922e-4a88-89e4-5175c23d9b5f.png)
  
### Retain content that contains sensitive information

You can also apply a retention policy only to content that contains [specific types of sensitive information](what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for.md). For example, you can choose to apply unique retention requirements only to content that contains personally identifiable information (PII) such as taxpayer identification numbers, social security numbers, or passport numbers.
  
![Sensitive information types page](../media/8b104819-d185-4d58-b6b3-d06e82686a05.png)
  
Notes:
  
- Advanced retention for sensitive information doesn't apply to Exchange public folders or Skype for Business because those locations don't support sensitive information types.
    
- You should understand that Exchange Online uses mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) to identify sensitive information, so this works only on messages in transit — not on all items already stored in a mailbox. For Exchange Online, this means that a retention policy can identify sensitive information and take retention actions only on messages that are received **after** the policy is applied to the mailbox. (Note that query-based retention described in the previous section doesn't have this limitation because it uses the search index to identify content.) 
    
## Applying a retention policy to an entire organization or specific locations

You can easily apply a retention policy to an entire organization, entire locations, or only to specific locations or users.
  
### Org-wide policy

One of the most powerful features of a retention policy is that it can apply to locations across Office 365, including:
  
- Exchange email
    
- SharePoint site collections
    
- OneDrive accounts
    
- Office 365 groups (applies to content in the group's mailbox and associated SharePoint site.)
    
- Exchange public folders
    

![All locations option](../media/retention-policies-all-locations.png)

Other important features of an org-wide retention policy include:
  
- There is no limit to the number of mailboxes or sites the policy can include.
    
- For Exchange, any new mailbox created after the policy is applied will automatically inherit the policy.
  
### A policy that applies to entire locations

When you choose locations, you can easily include or exclude an entire location, such as Exchange email or OneDrive accounts. To do so, toggle the **Status** of that location on or off. 
  
Like an org-wide policy, if a policy applies to any combination of entire locations, there is no limit to the number of mailboxes or sites the policy can include. For example, if a policy includes all Exchange email and all SharePoint sites, all sites and mailboxes will be included, no matter how many. And for Exchange, any new mailbox created after the policy is applied will automatically inherit the policy.

### A policy with specific inclusions or exclusions

You can also apply a retention policy to specific users, Office 365 groups, or sites. To do so, toggle the **Status** of that location on, and then use the links to include or exclude specific users, Office 365 groups, or sites. 
  
However, note that the following limits exist when you configure a retention policy that includes or excludes over 1,000 specific locations:
  
- Maximum numbers for the retention policy:
    - 1,000 mailboxes
    - 1,000 Office 365 groups
    - 1,000 users for Teams private chats
    - 1,000 Teams for Channel Messages
    - 100 sites (OneDrive or SharePoint)

- A tenant can contain no more than 10,000 retention policies.
    
Although these limits exist, you can avoid them by applying either an org-wide policy or a policy that applies to entire locations.
  
### Skype locations

Unlike Exchange email, you can't toggle the status of the Skype location on to include all users, but when you turn on that location, you then manually choose the users whose conversations you want to retain:

![Choose Skype location for retention policies](../media/skype-location-retention-policies.png)
  
When you select **Choose users**, you can quickly include all users by selecting the **Name** box in the column header. However, it's important to understand that each user counts as a specific inclusion in the policy. Therefore, if you include over 1,000 users, the limits noted in the previous section apply. Selecting all Skype users here is not the same as if an org-wide policy were able to include all Skype users by default. 
  
![Choose Skype users page](../media/f1742493-741a-4142-a564-d7d41ab0236a.png)
  
Note that **Conversation History**, a folder in Outlook, is a feature that has nothing to do with Skype archiving. **Conversation History** can be turned off by the end user, but archiving for Skype is done by storing a copy of Skype conversations in a hidden folder that is inaccessible to the user but available to eDiscovery.

### SharePoint locations

Your retention policy can retain content in SharePoint communication sites, team sites that aren't connected by Office 365 groups, and classic sites. Team sites connected by Office 365 groups aren't supported with this option and instead, use the **Office 365 groups** locations.

If you specify sites that aren't supported, these are ignored by the retention policy.

When you specify your locations for SharePoint sites, you don't need permissions to access the site and no validation is done at the time you specify the URL on the **Edit locations** page. However, the sites must be indexed and the sites you specify are checked that they exist at the end of the wizard.

If this check fails, you see a message that validation failed for the URL you entered, and the wizard won't create the retention policy until the validation check passes. If you see this message, go back in the wizard to change the URL or remove the site.

### Teams locations

> [!NOTE]
> We don't yet support configuration for retention of private channel messages. Retention of files shared in private channels is supported.

You can use a retention policy to retain chats and channel messages in Teams. Teams chats are stored in a hidden folder in the mailbox of each user included in the chat, and Teams channel messages are stored in a similar hidden folder in the group mailbox for the team. However, it's important to understand that Teams uses an Azure-powered chat service that also stores this data, and by default this service stores the data forever. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you use the Teams location to retain and delete Teams data. Using the Teams location will permanently delete data from both the Exchange mailboxes and the underlying Azure-powered chat service. For more information, see [Overview of security and compliance in Microsoft Teams](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871258).
  
Teams chats and channel messages are not affected by retention policies applied to user or group mailboxes in the Exchange or Office 365 groups locations. Even though Teams chats and channel messages are stored in Exchange, they're affected only by a retention policy that's applied to the Teams location.

> [!NOTE]
> If a user is included in an active retention policy that retains Teams data and you a delete a mailbox of a user who is included in this policy, to retain the data, the mailbox is converted into an [inactive mailbox](inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365.md). If you don't need to retain this data for the user, exclude the user from the retention policy before you delete their mailbox.
  
After a retention policy is assigned to a team, chat and channel messages can follow one of two paths:

![Diagram of retention flow for Teams chat and channel messages](../media/TeamsRetentionLifecycle.png)

1. **If a chat or channel message is modified or deleted** by the user during the retention period, the message is moved (or copied, in the case of edit) to the SubstrateHolds folder (which is a hidden folder in every user or group mailbox) and is stored in this folder until the retention period expires. Messages are permanently deleted on the day the retention period expires.

2. **If a chat or channel message isn't deleted** during the retention period, the message is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder within one day after the retention period expires (it takes from 0 to 24 hours). The message is permanently deleted one day after it is moved to the SubstrateHolds folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> Messages in the SubstrateHolds folder are searchable by eDiscovery tools. After a message is permanently deleted, it won't be returned in an eDiscovery search.

We're continuously working on optimizing retention functionality in Teams, and we plan to release new features in the coming months. In the meantime, here are a few limitations to be aware of:
  
- **Teams require a separate retention policy**. When you create a retention policy and toggle on the Teams location, all other locations toggle off. A retention policy that includes Teams can include only Teams and no other locations. 
    
- **Teams aren't included in an org-wide policy**. If you create an org-wide policy, Teams are not included because they require a separate retention policy. 
    
- **Teams doesn't support advanced retention**. When you create a retention policy, if you choose the [Advanced settings that apply a policy only to content that meets certain conditions](#advanced-settings-that-apply-a-policy-only-to-content-that-meets-certain-conditions), the Teams location is not available. At this time, retention in Teams applies to all of the chat and channel message content. 

- **Teams content in private channels isn't supported**. At this time, retention policies created for Teams don't apply to private channel messages. Only messages in standard channels are subject to a retention policy created for Teams. Support for retention policies for private channels is coming soon. 
    
- **Teams may take up to three days to clean up expired messages**. A retention policy applied to Teams will delete chat and channel messages when the retention period expires. However, it may take up to three days to clean up these messages and permanently delete them. Also, chat and channel messages will be searchable with eDiscovery tools during the time after the retention period expires and when messages are permanently deleted.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It used to be true that a retention policy couldn't delete Teams content that's less than 30 days old, but we've removed this limitation. Now the retention period for Teams content can be any number of days you choose and as short as one day. If you do have a retention period of one day, it will take up to three days after the retention period expires before messages are permanently deleted.
    
In Teams, files that are shared in chat are stored in the OneDrive account of the user who shared the file. Files that are uploaded into channels are stored in the SharePoint site for the team. Therefore, to retain or delete files in Teams, you need to create a retention policy that applies to OneDrive and Microsoft 365 Group locations. If you want to apply a policy to the files shared in Teams of just a specific user or team, you can choose the OneDrive or Microsoft 365 Group locations and include the specific user or team.
  
A retention policy that applies to Teams can use [Preservation Lock](#locking-a-retention-policy).
  
![Teams locations for chat and channel messages](../media/127345da-e802-4b3a-afc7-6e354dc3f409.png)
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you create retention policies for Skype or Teams locations in your organization, one of those policies is shown as the default folder policy when a user views the properties of a mailbox folder in the Outlook desktop client. This is an incorrect display issue in Outlook and [a known issue](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4491013/outlook-client-displays-teams-or-skype-for-business-retention-policies). What should be displayed as the default folder policy is the mailbox retention policy that's applied to the folder. The Skype or Teams retention policy is not applied to the user's mailbox.  

### Microsoft 365 groups locations

To retain content for an icrosoft 365 group, you need to use the Microsoft 365 groups location. Even though an Microsoft 365 group has an Exchange mailbox, a retention policy that includes the entire Exchange location won't include content in Microsoft 365 group mailboxes. A retention policy applied to an Microsoft 365 group includes both the group mailbox and site. A retention policy applied to an Microsoft 365 group protects the resources created by an Microsoft 365 group, which would include Microsoft Teams.

In addition, it's not possible to use the Exchange location to include or exclude a specific group mailbox. Although the Exchange location initially allows a group mailbox to be selected, when you try to save the retention policy, you receive an error that "RemoteGroupMailbox" is not a valid selection for the Exchange location. 

## Excluding specific types of Exchange items from a retention policy
By using PowerShell, you can exclude specific types of Exchange items from a retention policy. For example, you can exclude voicemail messages, IM conversations, and other Skype for Business Online content in mailboxes. You can also exclude calendar, note, and task items. This capability is available only by using PowerShell; it's not available in the UI when you create a retention policy.
  
To do this, use the  `ExcludedItemClasses` parameter of the  `New-RetentionComplianceRule` and  `Set-RetentionComplianceRule` cmdlets.

## Locking a retention policy
Some organizations may need to comply with rules defined by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 17a-4, which requires that after a retention policy is turned on, it cannot be turned off or made less restrictive. With Preservation Lock, you can lock the policy so that no one — including the administrator — can turn off the policy or make it less restrictive.
  
After a policy's been locked, no one can turn it off or remove locations from the policy. And it's not possible to modify or delete content that's subject to the policy during the retention period. After the policy's been locked, the only ways you can modify the retention policy are by adding locations to it or extending its duration. A locked policy can be increased or extended, but it can't be reduced or turned off.
  
Therefore, before you lock a retention policy, it's **critical** that you understand your organization's compliance requirements, and that **you do not lock a policy** until you're certain that's what you need.

### Lock a retention policy by using PowerShell
  
You can lock a retention policy only by using PowerShell.

First, [connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/office-365-scc/connect-to-scc-powershell/connect-to-scc-powershell?view=exchange-ps).

Second, to view a list of your retention policies and find the name of the policy that you want to lock, run `Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy`.

![List of retention policies in PowerShell](../media/retention-policy-preservation-lock-get-retentioncompliancepolicy.PNG)

Third, to place a Preservation Lock on the retention policy, run `Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy` with the `RestrictiveRetention` parameter set to true. For example:

`Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<Name of Policy>" – RestrictiveRetention $true`

![RestrictiveRetention parameter in PowerShell](../media/retention-policy-preservation-lock-restrictiveretention.PNG)

After you run that cmdlet, you see a confirmation prompt. Choose **Yes to All**.

![Prompt to confirm that you want to lock a retention policy in PowerShell](../media/retention-policy-preservation-lock-confirmation-prompt.PNG)

A Preservation Lock is now placed on the retention policy. If you run `Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy`, the `RestrictiveRetention` parameter is set to true. For example:

`Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<Name of Policy>" |Fl`

![Locked policy with all parameters shown in PowerShell](../media/retention-policy-preservation-lock-locked-policy.PNG)
  
## Releasing a retention policy

You can turn off or delete a retention policy at any time. When you do so, any SharePoint or OneDrive content that's being retained in the Preservation Hold library is not immediately and permanently deleted. Instead, to help prevent inadvertent data loss, there is a 30-day grace period, during which content expiration for that policy does not happen in the Preservation Hold library, so that you can restore any content from there, if needed. You can also turn on the retention policy again during the grace period, and no content will be deleted for that policy.

This 30-day grace period in SharePoint and OneDrive corresponds to the 30-day delay hold in Exchange. For more information, see [Managing mailboxes on delay hold](identify-a-hold-on-an-exchange-online-mailbox.md#managing-mailboxes-on-delay-hold).

## The principles of retention, or what takes precedence?

It's possible or even likely that content might have several retention policies applied to it, each with a different action (retain, delete, or both) and retention period. What takes precedence? At the highest level, rest assured that content being retained by one policy can't be permanently deleted by another policy.
  
![Diagram of the principles of retention](../media/1693d6ec-b340-4805-9da3-89aa41bc6afb.png)
  
To understand how different retention policies are applied to content, keep these principles of retention in mind:
  
1. **Retention wins over deletion.** Suppose that one retention policy says to delete Exchange email after three years, but another retention policy says to retain Exchange email for five years and then delete it. Any content that reaches three years old will be deleted and hidden from the users' view, but still retained in the Recoverable Items folder until the content reaches five years old, when it is permanently deleted. 
    
2. **The longest retention period wins.** If content is subject to multiple policies that retain content, it will be retained until the end of the longest retention period. 
    
3. **Explicit inclusion wins over implicit inclusion.** This means: 
    
    1. If a label with retention settings is manually assigned by a user to an item, such as an Exchange email or OneDrive document, that label takes precedence over both a policy assigned at the site or mailbox level and a default label assigned by the document library. For example, if the explicit label says to retain for 10 years, but the policy assigned to the site says to retain for only five years, the label takes precedence. Auto-applied labels are considered implicit, not explicit, because they're applied automatically by Microsoft 365.
    
    2. If a retention policy includes a specific location, such as a specific user's mailbox or OneDrive for Business account, that policy takes precedence over another retention policy that applies to all users' mailboxes or OneDrive for Business accounts but doesn't specifically include that user's mailbox.
    
4. **The shortest deletion period wins.** Similarly, if content's subject to multiple policies that delete content (with no retention), it will be deleted at the end of the shortest retention period. 
    
Understand that the principles of retention work as a tie-breaking flow from top to bottom: If the rules applied by all policies or labels are the same at one level, the flow moves down to the next level to determine precedence for which rule is applied.
  
Finally, a retention policy or label cannot permanently delete any content that's on hold for eDiscovery. When the hold is released, the content again becomes eligible for the cleanup process described above.
  
## Use a retention policy instead of these features

A single retention policy can easily apply to an entire organization and locations across Microsoft 365, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft 365 groups. If you need to retain or delete content anywhere in Microsoft 365, we recommend that you use a retention policy. (You can also use labels with retention settings. For more information, see [Overview of labels](labels.md).)
  
There are several other features that have previously been used to retain or delete content in Microsoft 365. These are listed below. These features will continue to work side by side with retention policies and retention labels. But moving forward, for information governance, we recommend that you use a retention policy or labels instead of all of these features. A retention policy is the only feature that can both retain and delete content across Microsoft 365.

If you've previously used any of the eDiscovery holds for the purpose of information governance, you should instead use a retention policy for proactive compliance. You should use a hold only for eDiscovery.
  
### Retention policies override information management policies

In SharePoint sites, you may be using [information management policies](intro-to-info-mgmt-policies.md) to retain content. If you apply a retention policy to a site that already uses content type policies or information management policies for a list or library, those policies are ignored while the retention policy is in effect. 
  
## What happened to preservation policies?

If you were using a preservation policy, that policy has been automatically converted to a retention policy that uses only the retain action — the policy won't delete content. The preservation policy continues to work and preserve your content without requiring any changes from you. You can find these policies on the **Policies** page in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), or on the **Retention** page under **Information governance** in the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/). You can edit a preservation policy to change the retention period, but you can't make other changes, such as adding or removing locations.

## Permissions

Members of your compliance team who will create retention policies need permissions to the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/). By default, your tenant admin has access to this location and can give compliance officers and other people access to the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/), without giving them all the permissions of a tenant admin. To do this, we recommend that you go to the **Permissions** page of the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/), edit the **Compliance Administrator** role group, and add members to that role group. 
  
For more information, see [Give users access to the Security & Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/grant-access-to-the-security-and-compliance-center). 

These permissions are required only to create and apply a retention policy. Policy enforcement does not require access to the content.
